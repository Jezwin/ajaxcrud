# ajaxcrud

Start off with landing.php. The index.php is just a bogus file.


AJAX is used for Add Actor, Add Genre and Delete Records option. *config.php is the script that connects with the database.* 

If the pen icon under action(in UI) is used to update the record it would do in the classic way. If AJAX has to be fired to just go inline, tap on any record you wanna edit and click outside once done.
